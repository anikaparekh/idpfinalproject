# Nutlin-3a Cancer Response Project - Raw Data

This folder contains the original datasets used in the Nutlin-3a Cancer Response Project. Due to file size limitations, the raw data is hosted externally.

Access the full datasets here: [Google Drive - Raw Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pouBRCLK31KN4bnA4FFAIUQQcinMuuzO/view?usp=drive_link)

## Contents

The dataset includes:
- Drug response metrics for Nutlin-3a as well as many other drugs, and which genomic pathways they target
- Genetic features of cancer cells and their relative sensitivity to drugs
- Cell line metadata (cancer type, p53 status)

## Notes
- The data is unprocessed and requires filtering, merging, and cleaning before analysis.
- Refer to the main README.md for how raw data was transformed for modeling and visualization.
