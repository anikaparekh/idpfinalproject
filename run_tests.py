This is the entry point to running all of your tests. 
You can do simple testing as we have done all year in your homework assignments. 
Or, you can leverage Python's Unit Test Framework which is a bit more complicated, but super cool.  

A common command to run the unit tests from the console is: python -m unittest discover -s tests -v

Your tests would all inherit from unittest.TestCase.

Take advantage of helper function in cse163_utils.py to help you with testing.
